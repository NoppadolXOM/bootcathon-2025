# Lab 5 - Multi-Agent (Stretch Goal)

## üéØ Objective

In this lab, you'll:

- Apply multi-agent architecture to create a more complex workflow
- Use AI agents to handle different tasks like querying databases and generating charts
- Learn how to integrate multiple AI agents to work together in a single workflow
- Understand the importance of memory integration for context-aware interactions
- Utilize the QuickChart node to visualize data from database queries

## üîß Prerequisites

- n8n setup locally or on a server.
- A MySQL-compatible database (e.g., Postgres or Microsoft SQL).
- API credentials for any LLM model you would like to use.

## Overview

In this lab, you will create a multi-agent workflow that allows users to interact with a database using natural language. The workflow will include an AI-powered chat interface that can query a MySQL database and generate charts based on user requests. This setup will enable users to retrieve insights and visualize data without needing to write SQL queries or configure charts manually.

### What problem does this solve?

It simplifies data exploration by combining AI Agent with database querying and chart generation. Users can interact with their database using natural language, retrieve insights, and visualize data without manual SQL queries or chart configuration.

### What this workflow does

1. AI-Powered Chat Interface:

    - Accepts natural language prompts to query databases or generate charts.
    Routes user requests through a tool agent system to determine the appropriate action (query or chart).

2. Database Querying:

    - Executes SQL queries on MySQL databases based on user input.
    - Retrieves schema information, table definitions, and specific data records.

3. Dynamic Chart Generation:

    - Uses QuickChart node to create bar charts, line charts, or other visualizations from database records.
    - Outputs a shareable chart URL or JSON configuration for further customization.

4. Memory Integration:
    - Maintains chat history using Simple memory nodes, enabling context-aware interactions.
    - Workflow diagram showcasing AI agents, database querying, and chart generation paths.

## üõ† Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Add "On chat message Trigger" Node

- This node listens for incoming messages from the Chat UI.

### Step 2: Add an "AI Agent" Node
1. Select the node under the AI section.
2. Add a **System Prompt**:
    ```
    You are a helpful assistant that answers the users questions by using the tools provided.

    ## TOOLS
    - query_database_tool: Use this tool to query the database
    - generate_chart_tool: Use this tool to generate a chart with QuickChart

    Always provide the results of the database query and the link for the chart when applicable.
    ```

- This node will handle the incoming chat messages and route them to the appropriate action (query or chart generation).

### Step 3: Set up `Language Model` connected to the Agent
1. Select your preferred model provider
2. Configure your model credentials (e.g., OpenAI or Groq).

### Step 4: Set up Agent's Memory
- Memory lets the agent remember things across messages - just like a human conversation.
- This allow the agent to handle muti-turn conversations.

1. Add `Simple Memory` and connect to the AI Agent

### Step 5: Add "Call n8n Workflow" tool for the "query_database_tool" and "generate_chart_tool" to execute the respective actions based on user input. Ensure to configure the tool with the necessary parameters for database queries and chart generation.

- Add workflow inputs for the "query_database_tool" as follows:
    - name: ```query_database_tool```
    - description: ```Use this tool to query the database```
    - user_prompt: ```{{ $('When chat message received').item.json.chatInput }}```
    - route: ```query_database_tool```

- Add workflow inputs for the "generate_chart_tool" as follows:
    - name: ```generate_chart_tool```
    - description: ```Use this tool to generate a chart with QuickChart```
    - user_prompt: ```{{ $('When chat message received').item.json.chatInput }}. Generate a chart for the data.```
    - route: ```generate_chart_tool```
    - db_records: Set it as defined automatically by the model with following description: ```The database records```

### Step 6: Create and configure the "When Executed By Workflow" trigger node to accept inputs from the previous nodes.

- Ensure it can receive following parameters from both database queries and chart generation:
    - `user_prompt`: String
    - `route`: String
    - `db_records`: String

### Step 7: Add "Switch" Node to route the workflow based on the action type (query or chart generation).
- In the Switch Node, set up two routing rules based on the `{{ $json.route }}` parameter:
    - Rule 1: If `route` is equal to `query_database_tool`, execute the database query.
    - Rule 2: If `route` is equal to `generate_chart_tool`, generate the chart using QuickChart.

### Step 8: Copy SQL agent from Lab 3 and link it to the Switch Node for the `query_database_tool` route.
- This node will execute SQL queries based on user input.

### Step 9: Add another agent for the `generate_chart_tool` route.
- Create "AI Agent" Node with the prompt (user message) below and link it to the Switch Node:

  ```txt
  Your task is to generate a Chart.js configuration object with the following specifications:
  - Chart type: bar unless otherwise indicated
  - Labels: Use the ML # from each record unless otherwise indicated
  - Show bar for list price if not otherwise indicated
  - Return only the raw JSON object without code fences or explanations

  This is the user prompt: {{ $json.user_prompt }}
  This is the result of the SQL query: {{ $json.db_records }}
  ```

- Enable `Require Specific Output Format` and add `Structured Output Parser` as the output parser of AI Agent.
- Use following JSON Example for Structured Output Parser:

  ```json
  {
    "output": {
      "type": "bar",
      "data": {
        "labels": ["ML #1", "ML #2", "ML #3"],
        "datasets": [
          {
            "label": "List Price",
            "data": [1000000, 1200000, 1100000],
            "backgroundColor": "rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)"
          }
        ]
      },
      "options": {
        "scales": {
          "y": {
            "min": 0,
            "max": 1500000
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- Add "QuickChart" Node and link it to the AI Agent Node for the `generate_chart_tool` route.

### Step 10: Configure the "QuickChart" Node to generate a chart based on the JSON output from the AI Agent.
Configure the QuickChart Node with the following settings:
- Chart type: ```{{ $json.output.type }}```
- Add Labels: From Array
- Labels Array: ```{{ $json.output.data.labels }}```
- Data: ```{{ $json.output.data.datasets[0].data }}```

Final step: Try chat with following questions:

- "List number of track in each album"
- "Generate a bar chart for the number of tracks in each album"
- "Show me the total sales by album"
- "Generate a pie chart for the total sales by album"

You should see the AI Agent responding with the SQL query results and a link to the generated chart.
